1.	INTRODUCTION
    Solar energy harnessing is a challenging process due to the lack of development in the existing technology. Present day technologies are having low conversion efficiency and cost of the technology is also very high. It is our responsibility to develop better technology with cost effectiveness to meet the energy needs of rural Indian villages where there is no accessibility to electric power. The rural Indian population will develop only when there is a accessible power. Solar energy is a major energy source due to its abundant availability in the subcontinent region.
2.	SOLAR PV
    Generating electricity from sunlight was found to be very expensive in the past decade. Due to very high electricity demand, the Government of India is encouraging the use of renewable energy resources such as solar to solve the power crisis and to make the environment greener and sustainable. Currently, the prices of power generation from solar are falling down due to technological advances in solar panels. In this regard, the central government is providing subsidies, tax savings to organizations/institutions/ households for adopting solar energy. 
   Mokhtari 2009, investigated the position of solar panel to ensure maximum sunlight and thus improving the overall efficiency of the photovoltaic generation system. An Induction motor was controlled using direct flux and torque control technique to optimize the location of the panel when the sun moves on its trajectory. Oltu 2007, and Dousoky 2011, identified that suitable orientation of solar panel using automatic solar trackers helps to improve the panel efficiency. 
    Gaddy, 2003 introduced photovoltaic panels generated electricity to produce propulsion. The power from solar was used in the components of vehicles such as to charge battery, a computer, inverters and electric traction motors. This minimizes the fuel consumption and its associated emissions, and can save significant cost of gasoline per Watt of photovoltaic power. 
    Rahman 2010, studied about enhancing the performance of PV solar home system with less investment. This is essential for rural homes where there is a shortage of grid power or the high cost involved for transmission and distribution systems. One of the major limitations of the solar home system is its extremely poor efficiency. Lot of research is going on to improve the performance of the solar, Solar Energy - a Road Map to Success for Rural Development 141 panels. Sun tracking is a method frequently adopted for performance enhancement. However sun tracking devices need expensive control and drive equipments and the power for these equipments has to be provided by the solar panel and the battery installed within the solar home system. Due to high cost and frequent maintenance requirement, such tracking systems are not popular. Even a slight enhancement of the performance of solar cells will drastically reduce the overall per unit energy cost of the solar home system. In this work, authors studied the performance of solar panels by direct reflection of sunlight experimentally. Encouraging results were obtained by fixing plane mirrors at the East-West ends of the panel edge when the panel is inclined at 23.5° with the horizontal. 
  Dai Qinghui 2009, conducted studies and performed survey and analysis to enhance the efficiency of solar power from PV panels. Their analysis showed that to improve the efficiency of solar power, study of technical aspects of the conversion efficiency of solar panels is necessary. This can be achieved through the solar energy application of automatic tracking system device. Also, the solar power control adopts maximum power point tracking technology and is suitable for storage battery charging and discharging functions. In addition, the application of complex mechanism of photosynthesis, and the “condenser”, which can strengthen the solar energy, will be a future research direction to improve the efficiency of solar power. 
  Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is a widely used control technique to extract maximum power available from the solar cell of photovoltaic (PV) module. Since the solar cells have non-linear i-v characteristics, the efficiency of PV module is very low and the power output depends on solar insulation level and ambient temperature, so maximization of power output with greater efficiency is of special interest. Moreover there is great loss of power due to mismatch of source and load. Siwakoti et al.[16] designed a system using microcontroller for MPPT; the authors claimed that with this arrangement, the system has high efficiency, lower cost, very fast tracking speed, and can be easily modified for additional control function for future use. 
  Ralph 1996 described solar panel designs that utilize new high-efficiency solar cells and lightweight rigid panel technologies. The resulting designs increase the specific power (W/kg) achievable in the near-term and are well suited to meet the demands of high performance small satellites (smallsats). Advanced solar panel designs have been developed and demonstrated on two NASA contracts. 
  Yaow-Ming 2005 presented the calculation of the optimum installation angle for fixed solarcell panels based on genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated-annealing (SA) methods. Their investigation reveals that the output power of the solar-cell panel is highly affected by the sunlight incident angle and its efficiency can be improved if the solar-cell panel is properly installed with the optimum angle. The relationship between the sunlight incident angle and the sunlight radiation intensity on the solar-cell panel surface is also presented in this research work. 
  Xiao Tang 2010, carried out research using a micro heat pipe array in solar panels for monitoring and controlling the effect of temperature on photovoltaic panels. Their research reveals that temperature can be controlled significantly to improve the efficiency of solar panels for certain operating conditions.
3.	SOLAR TRACKING SYSTEM
3.1.	Introduction:
(a)	Purpose:
A typical solar panel converts only 30 to 40 percent of the incident solar irradiation into electrical energy. Thus to get a constant output, an automated system is required which should be capable to constantly rotate the solar panel. The Sun Tracking System (STS) was made as a prototype to solve the problem, mentioned above. It is completely automatic and keeps the panel in front of sun until that is visible. The unique feature of this system is that instead of taking the earth as its reference, it takes the sun as a guiding source. Its active sensors constantly monitor the sunlight and rotate the panel towards the direction where the intensity of sunlight is maximum. With the rapid increase in population and economic development, the problems of the energy crisis and global warming effects are today a cause for increasing concern. The utilization of renewable OPEN ACCESS Sensors 2013,13 3158 energy resources is the key solution to these problems. Solar energy is one of the primary sources of clean, abundant and inexhaustible energy that not only provides alternative energy resources, but also improves environmental pollution. The most immediate and technologically attractive use of solar energy is through photovoltaic conversion. The physics of the PV cell (also called solar cell) is very similar to the classical p-n junction diode. The PV cell converts the sunlight directly into direct current (DC) electricity by the photovoltaic effect. A PV panel or module is a packaged interconnected assembly of PV cells. In order to maximize the power output from the PV panels, one needs to keep the panels in an optimum position perpendicular to the solar radiation during the day. As such, it is necessary to have it equipped with a Sun tracker. Compared to a fixed panel, a mobile PV panel driven by a Sun tracker may boost consistently the energy gain of the PV panel.
(b)	Scope:
•	It can be used for small and medium scale power generations.
•	It can be used for power generation at remote places where power lines are not accessible.
•	It can be used for domestic and industrial power backup system.
•	Solar radiation Tracker has played a vital role in increasing the efficiency of solar panels in recent years, thus proving to be a better technological achievement. The vital importance of a dual axis solar tracker lies in its better efficiency and sustainability to give a better output compared to a fived solar panel or a single axis solar tracker. The tracking system is designed such that it can trap the solar energy in all possible directions.


(c)	 Definition:
A Solar tracker is an automated solar panel which actually follows the sun to get maximum power. The primary benefit of a tracking system is to collect solar energy for the longest period of the day, and with the most accurate alignment as the Sun’s position shifts with the seasons. Dual Axis Tracker has two different degrees through which they use as axis of rotation. The dual axis are usually at a normal of each rotate both east to west (zenithal) and north to south. Solar tracking is the most appropriate technology to enhance the electricity production of a PV system. To achieve a high degree of tracking accuracy, several approaches have been widely investigated. Generally, they can be classified as either open-loop tracking types based on solar movement mathematical models or closed-loop tracking types using sensor-based feedback controllers. In the open-loop tracking approach, a tracking formula or control algorithm is used. Referring to the literature, the azimuth and the elevation angles of the Sun were determined by solar movement models or algorithms at the given date, time and geographical information. The control algorithms were executed in a microprocessor controller. In the closed-loop tracking approach, various active sensor devices, such as charge couple devices (CCDs) or light dependent resistors (LDRs) were utilized to sense the Sun’s position and a feedback error signal was then generated to the control system to continuously receive the maximum solar radiation on the PV panel. This paper proposes an empirical research approach on this issue. Solar tracking approaches can be implemented by using single-axis schemes, and dual-axis structures for higher accuracy systems. In general, the single-axis tracker with one degree of freedom follows the Sun’s movement from the east to west during a day while a dual-axis tracker also follows the elevation angle of the Sun. In recent years, there has been a growing volume of research concerned with dual-axis solar tracking systems. However, in the existing research, most of them used two stepper motors or two DC motors to perform dual-axis solar tracking. With two tracking motors designs, two motors were mounted on perpendicular axes, and even aligned them in certain directions. In some cases, both motors could not move at the same time. Furthermore, such systems always involve complex tracking strategies using microprocessor chips as a control platform. In this work, employing a dual-axis with only single tracking motor, an attempt has been made to develop and implement a simple and efficient control scheme. The two axes of the Sun tracker were allowed to move simultaneously within their respective ranges. Utilizing conventional electronic circuits, no programming or computer interface was needed. Moreover, the proposed system used a stand-alone PV inverter to drive motor and provide power supply. The system was self-contained and autonomous. Experiment results have demonstrated the feasibility of the tracking PV system and verified the advantages of the proposed control implementation.


3.2.	 Overall Description:
3.2.1.	Product Perspective:
(a)	System Interface:
ATmega328p Microcontroller: The high-performance Microchip Pico Power 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller combines 32KB ISP flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 1024B EEPROM, 2KB SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire serial interface, SPI serial port, a 6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8- channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts.
 
(b)	User Interface:
It should be the connector between the various systems and the system or between other parts or unit of the system.
(c)	Hardware Interface:
Solar Panel: Solar panel refers to a panel designed to absorb the sun's rays as a source of energy for generating electricity or heating. Photovoltaic modules use light energy (photons) from the Sun to generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect. The majority of modules use wafer-based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells. The structural (load carrying) member of a module can either be the top layer or the back layer. Cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moisture. Most modules are rigid, but semi-flexible ones are available, based on thin-film cells. The cells must be connected electrically in series, one to another. Externally, most of photovoltaic modules use MC4 connector’s type to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the system. Modules electrical connections are made in series to achieve a desired output voltage and/or in parallel to provide a desired current capability. The conducting wires that take the current off the modules may contain silver, copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals. Bypass diodes may be incorporated or used externally, in case of partial module shading, to maximize the output of module sections still illuminated.  
Arduino UNO Microcontroller: Arduino is an open source, computer hardware and software company, project, and user community that designs and manufactures microcontroller kits for building digital devices and interactive objects that can sense and control objects in the physical world. The project's products are distributed as open-source hardware and software, which are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the GNU General Public License (GPL) permitting the manufacture of Arduino boards and software distribution by anyone. Arduino boards are available commercially in preassembled form, or as do-it yourself kits. Arduino board designs use a variety of microprocessors and controllers. The boards are equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The boards feature serial communications interfaces, including Universal Serial Bus (USB) on some models, which are also used for loading programs from personal computers. The microcontrollers are typically programmed using a dialect of features from the programming languages C and C++. In addition to using traditional compiler tool chains, the Arduino project provides an integrated development environment (IDE) based on the Processing language project. Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P. It has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs), 6 analog inputs, a 16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB connection, a power jack, an ICSP header and a reset button. It contains everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to a computer with a USB cable or power it with a AC to DC adapter or battery to get started.. You can tinker with your UNO without working too much about doing something wrong, worst case scenario you can replace the chip for a few dollars and start over again.
 
LDRs: A Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) or a photo resistor is a device whose resistivity is a function of the incident electromagnetic radiation. Hence, they are light sensitive devices. They are also called as photo conductors, photo conductive cells or simply photocells. They are made up of semiconductor materials having high resistance. A photo resistor is made of a high resistance semiconductor. In the dark, a photo resistor can have a resistance as high as several mega ohms (MΩ), while in the light, a photo resistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms. If incident light on a photo resistor exceeds a certain frequency, photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole partners) conduct electricity, thereby lowering resistance. The resistance range and sensitivity of a photo resistor can substantially differ among dissimilar devices. Moreover, unique photo resistors may react substantially differently to photons within certain wavelength bands.
 
Servo Motors: A servomotor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator that allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback. It also requires a relatively sophisticated controller, often a dedicated module designed specifically for use with servomotors. Servomotors are not a specific class of motor although the term servomotor is often used to refer to a motor suitable for use in a closed-loop control system. A servomotor is a closed-loop servomechanism that uses position feedback to control its motion and final position. The input to its control is a signal (either analogue or digital) representing the position commanded for the output shaft. The motor is paired with some type of encoder to provide position and speed feedback. In the simplest case, only the position is measured. The measured position of the output is compared to the command position, the external input to the controller. If the output position differs from that required, an error signal is generated which then causes the motor to rotate in either direction, as needed to bring the output shaft to the appropriate position. As the positions approach, the error signal reduces to zero and the motor stops.The very simplest servomotors use position-only sensing via a potentiometer and bang-bang control of their motor; the motor always rotates at full speed (or is stopped). This type of servomotor is not widely used in industrial motion control, but it forms the basis of the simple and cheap servos used for radio-controlled models. More sophisticated servomotors use optical rotary encoders to measure the speed of the output shaft and a variable-speed drive to control the motor speed. Both of these enhancements, usually in combination with a PID control algorithm, allow the servomotor to be brought to its commanded position more quickly and more precisely, with less overshooting.
 
(d)	Software Interface: Arduino IDE:-A program for Arduino may be written in any programming language for a compiler that produces binary machine code for the target processor. Atmel provides a development environment for their microcontrollers, AVR Studio and the newer Atmel Studio. The Arduino project provides the Arduino integrated development environment (IDE), which is a cross-platform application written in the programming language Java. It originated from the IDE for the languages Processing and Wiring. It includes a code editor with features such as text cutting and pasting, searching and replacing text, automatic indenting, brace matching, and syntax highlighting, and provides simple one-click mechanisms to compile and upload programs to an Arduino board. It also contains a message area, a text console, a toolbar with buttons for common functions and a hierarchy of operation menus. A program written with the IDE for Arduino is called a sketch. Sketches are saved on the development computer as text files with the file extension.ino. Arduino Software (IDE) pre1.0 saved sketches with the extension.pde. The Arduino IDE supports the languages C and C++ using special rules of code structuring. The Arduino IDE supplies a software library from the Wiring project, which provides many common input and output procedures. User-written code only requires two basic functions, for starting the sketch and the main program loop, that are compiled and linked with a program stub main() into an executable cyclic executive program with the GNU tool chain, also included with the IDE distribution. The Arduino IDE employs the program to convert the executable code into a text file in hexadecimal encoding that is loaded into the Arduino board by a loader program in the board's firmware.

4.	BLOCK DIAGRAM OF SYSTEM
         In the given block diagram we have seen that when the sunlight is falling on solar tracker module then this energy is converted into electrical energy and this energy is stored in the energy storing devices and after according to the requirements we can covert the energy form by inverter and converter and used in variable load such as irrigation, electrical fences, pedestal lightning, rural electrification etc.

6.	SIMULATION WORK

Now we are working on two software:
A.	MATLAB
B.	PROTEUS
6.1	 MATLAB:
For the simulation work on MATLAB follow the following three steps:
A.	Model the physical system 
B.	Design the controller  
C.	Test the design
The physical system has two main components with some basic physics. We need to write the equation of motion for both panel and motor.  

6.1.1	Model The Physical System:
First we model the panel in Simulink on mat lab. Firstly we start from integrator block. By using integrator block we integrate acceleration into velocity and then velocity in a position. This is basics for modeling differential equation in Simulink. To visualizing the signal scope blocks are used.

 
Second we still need a motor. Remember the motor equation and follow the steps to model it and supply a voltage to the motor to generate the torque and move the panel.
6.1.2	Design A Controller
In a fixed type model without controller we find out a problem that is the maximum error between the sunlight motion and the PV tracker module movement. So reduce this error we need to design a controller. In (table 1) fixed type tracker and (table 2) dual axis solar tracker output are shown below:		













We will add a PID controller that applies a voltage to the motor to make that error as small as possible and if sun moves the controller will react accordingly to keep the panel pointing at the sun.

•	Pedestal Lightning
7.1	 IRRIGATION SYSTEM
Introduction:
The continuous increasing of food demand requires the improvement in food production technology. The food production requires continues monitoring of crops for irrigation with the help of humans. This continuous monitoring by humans is not possible for all the time. Hence automatic irrigation system is a suitable one which helps to irrigate the crops without the help of human intervention. This system will have continuous monitoring that helps better production. Automatic irrigation system is a new model developed using advancement in communication technology. This system will monitor the soil moisture and environment temperature using wireless sensor networks. The sensed information are send to a centralized computing server for making computation and to report the need of irrigation based on the values received from the sensors. The WSN is integrated with the microcontroller for regulating the functionality of the motor pumps which are part of the system. When the soil requires water the microcontroller instruct the motor pumps to supply water in the field.
Automatic Irrigation System:
Irrigation plays a vital role in the plantation of crops. The manual supply of water does not give an ultimate result for food production. The better production needs a correct amount of water at a right time. The introduction of Automatic Irrigation System aims to lessen the consumption of water from the over usage of water in the agricultural field. The Automatic Irrigation System improves the monitoring of crops often without the help of manpower. The Automatic Irrigation System designed with the Wireless Sensor Network and Mobile communication. The WSN consists of sensors which are employed in the agricultural field for sensing the moisture and temperature of the soil. The sensed data are bring under the microcontroller for regulating the valve of the pump. If the moisture of the soil gets decreased, the sensor sends the data to the microcontroller. Then the microcontroller instructs the valve to turn on. After reaching the threshold value of the moisture, the microcontroller instructs the valve to turn off. The updated value of the moisture and temperature and the action taken by the microcontroller will be send to the user.   
                         
A block diagram reveals in which scenario the automation irrigation system works. The moisture and temperature sensors are employed in the agricultural field for sensing the level of moisture and temperature of the soil. The sensors are integrated with the single chipped microcontroller which is used to calculate and process the data from the sensor. The sensed information is send to the microcontroller in the form of digital signals. The microcontroller processes the digitalized data and takes relevant actions to regulating the water pump. If the processed data of the soil moisture is low, the motor is indicated by the microcontroller to turn on the water pump.
A.  Sensor: The sensor is electronic equipment employed to identify and react to the natural phenomena and takes it as their input. The input such as moisture, pressure , temperature, heat and light. The signals are generated as the output of the signal which is in the form of human-readable format to the specified location is transmitted through a network for further analysis or processing. In this paper the two sensors are used majorly for sensing which are listed below.
B. Soil Moisture Sensor: Soil moisture sensor is used for the measuring of the water content in the soil. The traditional quantities description of the soil requires a various methods such removing drying etc., but the soil moisture sensor indirectly measure the water level of the soil by using the another set of property such as electrical resistance, dielectric constant or the synergy of the neutrons. The soil moisture may vary according to the temperature, soil type and the electrical conductivity. The set of moisture sensor will help to find out the potential of the water, hence this type of sensors called soil water potential sensors.
 
C. Temperature Sensor: Temperature sensor senses the temperature from the various range of physical body. It is one of the main thing had often calculated. The sensing of the temperature using temperature sensor is done by two ways either by direct or indirect method. The direct method is done by made a contact with the source and the indirect method is done without contacting the source body instead of that using radiated energy of the source. In this project, we are using DHT11 which is the temperature sensor. It consists of four pins, the first pins is used for the voltage supply, the second pin is used as the output pin, the third pin is considered as NULL pin and the last pin is used for the ground supply.
7.2	 ELECTRICAL FENCES
Introduction:
In the world, the economy of many countries is dependent upon agriculture. In spite of economic development agriculture is the backbone of the economy. Agriculture is the main stay of economy. It contributes to the gross domestic product. Agriculture meets food requirements of the people and produces several raw materials for industries. But because of animal interference in agricultural lands, there will be huge loss of crops. Crop will be totally getting destroyed. There will be large amount of loss of farmer. To avoid these financial losses it is very important to protect agricultural field or farms from animal. To overcome this problem, in our proposed work we shall design a system to prevent the entry of animals into the farm. The main purpose of project is to develop prohibitive fencing to the farm, to avoid losses due to animals. These prohibitive fencing protect the crop from damaging that indirectly increase yield of the crop. The develop system will not harmful and injurious to animal as well as human beings. Theme of project is to design a intelligent security system for farm protection by using Embedded system. Crops are vulnerable to animals. Therefore, it is very important to monitor the nearby presence of animals. Then the actuation of various devices should follow to repel the hazardous animals. In this project, we propose a method to protect farms from wild animals via ubiquitous wired network devices, which is applied to farm along with traditional methods to improve the protection performance. Operational amplifier circuits are utilized mainly for the detection of animal intrusion from the outside of farms. The proposed monitoring scheme is to provide an early warning about possible intrusion and damage by wild animals. The Solar Electric Fence system is a modern day alternative to conventional methods of fencing to protect your crops & property. Electric Fence is an effective way to reducing losses caused by animals.

Electrical Fences:
 The fence is like barbed wire fencing with multiple strands of plain wires and metal/cement/ Wooden posts to hold the strands in position. The wires carry high voltage current. The Solar Electrical Fence gives a sharp, short but a non-lethal shock to the intruder and creates Psychological fear, against any tampering. The alarm incorporated in the system gets activated and alert the inmates of the protected area. These are tailor made fences and can be designed according to customer needs and site condition.
Working:
 A solar panel is made up of a number of photovoltaic cells connected in series. Electricity is generated by these cells. Combined into a solar panel, these cells can produce enough voltage to charge a regular 12 volt battery. The solar panel ensures that the battery remains charged at all times. The battery stores the energy generated by the panel, and powers the energizer 24 hours a day. The energizer is the device which transforms the low voltage current from battery to high voltage (up to 10,000 volts) current and sends it to the electric fence. This way the fence is electrified and animals touching the fence receive the shock. Due to high voltage shock to the animals touching the fence, animals keep away from the fence and field is protected.
Components:
A.	PIR Sensor: PIR sensor is used for monitoring the Motion of animals and people which is fed to microcontroller. PIR sensor also detects the heat of body.
B.	Energizer:
The energizer is the device which transforms the low voltage current from battery to high Voltage current sent to the electric fence. The current voltage can be stepped up to 10,000 Volts. The voltage requirement varies based on the type of animal to be kept away. However, Most of the animals can be kept away with voltage of 6000 – 7000 volts. There are several factors that to be considered when selecting an energizer:
a. The type of stock that will be fenced.
b. The size of the area to be fenced.
c. The total length of wire to be electrified and type of fence.
C.	Earth system: For an electric fence shock the current produced by an energizer must complete a full circuit. The current leaves the energizer and moves along the fence wires through the animal, into the soil and back to the energizer via the earth system. If the earth system is ineffective the animal will receive an inadequate shock..The earth system consists of a number of earth rods that provide an effective (low resistance) path for the current to return to the energizer's earth terminal. Larger energizers with large fence lines require more earthing rods. Larger energizers exerting more power on extensive fence systems require a larger earth system capable of capturing current returning to the energizer via the soil. Soil types, mineral content, and ground moisture and also fence load are all factors that determine how many earth rods will be required. Earth system is the most important component of electric fence. An effective earth system will optimize the performance of electric fence. Following two types of earthing systems are practiced in the country.
 

7.3	 RURAL ELECTRIFICATION:
Introduction: 
India has one of the fastest growing economics in the world and ranked sixth place in the worldwide consumer of energy. Being the seventh largest country in the world, six thousand villages inhabit 72.2 percent of its human resource (census 2001). About, 40 percent of the total energy is in rural areas. Domestic sector constitutes major energy demand and its consumption accounts for 60 percent of energy used. The main energy sources are coal and oil, whilst hydro, wind, nuclear and biomass provide additional sources. Following are some of the salient aspects having direct and indirect bearings on energy supply, to rural
[1] • Both the traditional energy and commercial energy are in short supply and the demand supply gap is in increase.
 • Pressure on traditional energy resources such as wood is continuously increasing due to growing population
• Heavy dependence on commercial fuels such as coal and oil as a short term measure for meeting increasing demand is alarming in view of depleting fossil fuels and pollution.
• Energy supply to far–off rural areas is associated with high transportation and transmission losses of  about 22.4%. Thus emphasis should be laid on the auditing of the energy in such a way that ensures affordable, ecofriendly and clean energy. There are two ways of supplying electrical energy to rural areas-one extending grid to nearby areas and other distributed generation particularly in deep rural areas. Importance of rural electrification and advantages in the third world discussed.
[2]. Majority of rural electrification is carried out by the existing grid extension. The need of modifying the existing grid connected supply in rural India.
Features of Rural Electrification:
Rural electrification is an important component of Integrated Rural Development. In India, it has been given less importance with respect to urban, because of the following reasons.
•	Villages are located from 3-80 km away from existing grid or even more. 
•	They are located in difficult terrain areas like forests, hill areas and deserts.
•	The number of households may range between 2 to 200, with a majority of villages having a population below 500. 
•	60% of the 5 67000 villages in India have a population of 500 and under and 8% of these are   inaccessible. (Source: Census 2001).
•	Power demand in villages is quite low due to dispersed distribution of loads. Also rural domestic consumers are mainly peak time consumers, contributing for poor load factors of 0.2-0.3. 
 

7.4	 PEDESTAL LIGHTING SYSTEM
Introduction: The energy consumption in entire world is increasing at the fastest rates due to population growth and economic development and the availability of energy sources remains woefully constrained. Resource augmentation and growth in energy supply has not kept pace with increasing demand and, therefore, India continues to face serious energy shortages. The project aims at harvesting the energy from renewable energy sources like sun and to effectively use the harvested energy for the benefit of remote villages (villagers) facing the serious power problems. The main aim of the project is to provide a “Smart Street Lighting System” powered with solar energy to assist the villagers during night time. We use the word “smart” because the system not only provide power to the street lights but also helps in detecting the direction of movement of the pedestrian and helps him by means of illuminating the path of movement till the near next street light. By integrating the entire street lights with Smart street light system it is possible to systematically help the pedestrian to reach the destination in the remote rural areas which are facing serious electric power supply problem. The same system can also be used for the House lighting purpose as it works on the principle of sensing the thermal signature of human body to switch the light, there by the system helps in saving the electric power.
Function Description: The design basically includes three working modes:-  OFF mode: When there is enough natural light in the surrounding i.e. during the
•	Daytime, the entire system is switched off and the batteries are charging.  Active mode: When the natural light drops below a certain level the system automatically
•	Turns on and the motion sensors are powered.  ON mode: On the presence of pedestrians, the sensors turn the relays on which in turn
•	Switches on the LED lights. This light turns off after a fixed period of time.

8.1	 Dual Axis Solar Tracking System:
Solar tracker is a device used for orienting a solar PV panel towards the sun by using solar or light sensor.
 
The output of solar tracking system power used in various applications like 
8.2	 Irrigation System:
Irrigation is the artificial application of water to the land or soil. To make the farming work easily the irrigation system is created and to prevent excessive uses of water and electricity.
 
8.3	 Electric Fencing:
Electrical fences can be used to protect farmhouse, farmlands etc from animals. In a way, these simulate the job of guards. These control the animals by giving them a short, sharp but safe shock that techs them to stay away from the fence
 
8.4	 Rural Electrification:
Rural electrification is the process of bringing electrical power to the rural area. Electricity is used not only for lightning and household purposes, but it also allows for mechanization of many farming  operation such as threshing, milking and hoisting grains  deform storage in areas facing labor shortages this allows for greater productivity at reduced cost.
 
8.5	 Pedestal Lightning:
This solar powered pedestal lighting system uses power LEDs for lighting. Solar energy is first converted into DC electricity by a solar photovoltaic cell and used to charge a storage battery. The solar energy stored in the battery is utilized at night for pedestal lighting using power LEDs.
 
8.6	 Model Of Project Solar Ecosystem For Rural Development:
Solar energy is basically energy received from the sun via solar radiation, which can be used actively or passively by converting into heat or electricity. The review paper discusses how the solar energy could support the development of rural areas in our country.
 

The figure of project shows the application of output of solar tracker system.
 


9.	ADVANTAGES OF SYSTEM
•	It protect against power interruption.
•	Reduces the water usage.
•	It brings new economic opportunities.
•	In rural areas around the world, however, access to electricity is sparse and expensive.
•	The use of solar power in rural areas is a cheaper, cleaner alternative.
•	One significant benefit of solar power in rural areas is increased availability.
•	Rural areas lack this resource because their countries’ electric grids stop before reaching them.
•	Major benefit is this system is pollution-free.
•	The advantages of solar power in rural areas illustrate that the development of better solar technology is beneficial for areas that otherwise would not be able to access electricity.




10.	DISADVANTAGES OF SYSTEM
•	Solar doesn’t work at night.
•	The biggest disadvantage of solar energy is that it’s not constant.  So energy must be stored or sourced elsewhere at night.
•	over winter months when there are less sunlight hours and sun radiation is less intense.
•	Solar electricity storage technology has not reached its potential.
•	Many solar drip feed batteries available, these are currently costly and bulky, and more appropriate to small scale home solar panels than large solar farms.
•	The downfall is that thin-film is currently less efficient than crystalline wafer solar.

11.	FUTURE SCOPE
•	Since majority of the population live in rural areas, there is much scope for solar cases ecosystem being promoted in these areas. Use of solar energy can reduce the use of firewood and dung cakes by rural household.
•	Solar will be seen more as a viable energy source, not just as an alternative to other renewable sources but also to a significant proportion of conventional grid power.
•	The testing and refinement of off-grid and rooftop solar models in the seed phase will help lead to the explosive growth of this segment in the growth phase.
•	Global prices for photovoltaic (PV) modules are dropping, reducing the overall cost of generating solar power.
•	According to one estimates, the combination of electricity demand growth, fossil fuel cost and availability challenges, and supportive environmental regulations could increase solar power capacity.

12.	CONCLUSION
•	The invention of solar tracking system helps us improve the performance of PV Solar system in simple way.
•	Improved the utilization rate of solar energy and efficiency of photovoltaic power generation system.
•	This high efficiency energy used for rural development.
•	When used in rural electrification, no need of power through grid system.
•	When used in irrigation systems then save the wastage of extra water and electricity.
•	Renewal energy help in development of rural area of our locality.
•	As per the geographical location of the country, India stands to its benefit and has tremendous scope of generating solar energy. Solar Power Generation alone can cater more than 60-65% of our entire need of power.
